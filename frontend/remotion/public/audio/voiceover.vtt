Tokenized real-world assets on Avalanche.

3
00:00:05,486 --> 00:00:13,083
Treasury bills, real estate, private credit — traditionally difficult to access, slow to settle, and opaque.

4
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:17,763
DeepRock makes them composable, instant, and transparent.

5
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:20,263
Five asset classes.

6
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:26,597
A growing directory of investment pools — each independently audited with live transparency.

7
00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:30,583
One biometric scan creates a smart wallet.

8
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,902
No seed phrases.

00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:35,097
No extensions.

10
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:42,250
The portfolio dashboard tracks every position in real time — balance, returns, allocation breakdowns.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,305
All on-chain.

12
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,541
All verifiable.

13
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:54,097
Each pool shows APY, risk rating, lockup terms, and remaining capacity — all visible before you invest.

14
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:56,180
Select a pool.

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,375

Confirm.

17
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:04,125
Sub-second finality — no T-plus-two delays.

18
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:09,611
Documents are sealed on-chain with cryptographic proofs anyone can verify.

19
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:14,416
Keys are secured biometrically — non-custodial by design.

20
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,166
